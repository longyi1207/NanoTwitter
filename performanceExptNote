EXPLANATION:
To assess and increase the performance of the three core functions of our app 
-- user following, tweeting, and reading timeline,
We recorded the time each operation takes,
So that we could future compare different optimization approaches.

For each experiment, please call ROUTES
/test/reset?user_count=1000
/test/stress?n=500&star=666&fan=888
and then query the time by searching in PAPERTRAIL by "TEST STRESS:",
and record the time of three operations here.

For validity, for each experiment please repeat these process THREE times and record all of them
